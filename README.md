# Password-Generator
A random password generator based on the criteria you select

1. Created a password object with blank values.
2. Working prompts that fill in the values for the object.
3. If statements that create a string with the values the user wanted.
4. Move to generatePassword function. Get the integer length of the password the user wants.
5. Create a for loop using that length.
6. I put +1 at the end of the random number function because the index of charAt starts at 0.
7. use charAt and your randomly picked index to pick each character of the password.
8. returned the full password.
9. Uncommented out the original given code.
